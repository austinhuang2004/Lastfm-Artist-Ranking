For this code I first started part 1 by going through the opeanweather and making a class for it.
In the class, I included the different parameters needed and also the attributes that were needed for the test.
Then I used the test sample to check if it works and moved on to the lastfm module. Also adding erros.
For the lastfm module, I did basically the same thing as part 1 but used a specific data from the lastfm api.
I did the getartist and made it so that it works with the given sample test. Then I added the erros.
After doing both, I added the transclude and also put it into the ui.py so that people are able to use it.
Then I refractored the redunant code and put it into the webapi.py.
After doing everything I used pylint and pycodestyle to make it better.
Added unit tests and finished.
